# UI/UX Design Document

This document outlines the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) flow for the application, aiming to provide a blueprint for frontend development and design.

## I. Core Design Principles

*   **Simplicity & Clarity:** The interface will prioritize ease of use, avoiding clutter and ensuring that options are straightforward and intuitive.
*   **Guided Experience:** Users will be supported at each step with tooltips, illustrative examples, and contextual information to facilitate understanding and usage.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** To prevent overwhelming users, especially new ones, information and options will be revealed progressively. Advanced features may be initially hidden or less prominent.
*   **Feedback & Responsiveness:** The system will provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions. For operations that take time, progress indicators will be displayed.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The design will emphasize that the generated schema is a working draft that can be easily and iteratively modified by the user.

## II. Key Screens / Components

### A. Dashboard / Project Management Screen

*   **Purpose:** Serves as the main entry point for users. Allows management of existing schema design projects and initiation of new ones.
*   **Elements:**
    *   Prominent "New Project" button.
    *   A list or grid of existing projects, displaying names, last modified dates, and potentially a thumbnail or icon representing the schema.
    *   Search and filter options to quickly locate specific projects.
    *   Access to user account settings and help resources, typically located in the top-right corner.
*   **UX Flow:** User logs in (if user accounts are implemented) or accesses the application -> lands on the dashboard -> clicks "New Project" to start a new design or selects an existing project to continue working.

### B. Input Selection & Provision Screen (Part of Project Workspace)

*   **Purpose:** Enables users to provide the source information from which the database schema will be inferred or generated.
*   **Layout:** A tabbed interface or a sequential, wizard-like approach for different input methods to keep the UI organized.
*   **Input Methods:**
    1.  **Textual Input Tab (Default View):**
        *   A large, resizable text area for users to type natural language descriptions of their data or paste code snippets (SQL DDL, ORM definitions).
        *   A dropdown menu to manually specify the language or type of input (e.g., "Natural Language," "SQL - PostgreSQL," "Python - SQLAlchemy," "Java - JPA"). This should ideally feature auto-detection with an option for the user to override.
        *   An "Analyze" or "Process Input" button to submit the text for processing.
        *   Placeholder text or clickable examples provided within or below the text area to guide users.
    2.  **File Upload Tab:**
        *   A drag-and-drop area and/or a traditional "Browse Files" button for uploading files.
        *   Clearly stated supported file types (initially CSV, JSON).
        *   For CSV files, an option (checkbox or toggle) to specify if the first row contains headers.
        *   An "Upload and Analyze" button.
        *   A list displaying uploaded files with their status (e.g., "Uploaded," "Processing," "Error").
    3.  **Structured Input Tab (Advanced / Manual Mode):**
        *   A simple form-based interface or a guided wizard that allows users to define tables, columns, data types, and basic relationships directly and manually.
        *   This is useful for users who already have a clear schema in mind or want to start building from scratch without relying on automated inference.
*   **UX Flow:** After creating or selecting a project, the user is directed to this screen -> they choose their preferred input method (text, file, or structured) -> provide the necessary input -> click the "Analyze" or "Process" button.
*   **Tooltips & Guidance:** Tooltips will be available for language selection, explaining file format expectations, and providing example phrases for effective natural language input.

### C. Schema Visualization and Editing Screen (Main Workspace)

*   **Purpose:** To visually represent the generated or user-defined database schema and provide tools for interactive editing and refinement.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Main Canvas:** The central area where tables are displayed as graphical boxes, with columns listed inside them. Relationships between tables are shown as connecting lines.
    *   **Toolbar:** Located typically at the top or side, containing tools for adding new tables, editing selected schema elements, managing relationships, zooming in/out, and auto-arranging the layout for clarity.
    *   **Properties Panel (Contextual):** A panel (often on the right side) that appears when a table, column, or relationship is selected on the canvas. It allows editing of:
        *   **Table:** Name, comments/description.
        *   **Column:** Name, data type (selected from a dropdown of supported types), constraints (checkboxes or toggles for Primary Key, Foreign Key, Not Null, Unique), default value, comments.
        *   **Relationship:** Type (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many), the specific tables and columns involved, and referential integrity actions (`ON DELETE`, `ON UPDATE`).
    *   Dedicated "Add Table" and "Add Column" (to selected table) buttons for quick additions.
*   **Visual Representation:**
    *   Tables are represented as draggable and resizable boxes.
    *   Columns are listed within their respective table boxes, with clear indicators for PK, FK, and other constraints.
    *   Relationships are depicted as lines connecting columns of different tables, using standard notations like Crow's Foot to indicate cardinality.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Clicking on a table, column, or relationship line selects it and populates the Properties Panel with its details.
    *   Drag-and-drop functionality for creating relationships (e.g., dragging from a column in one table to a column in another).
    *   Right-click context menus on schema elements for quick actions like "Delete Table," "Edit Column," "Remove Relationship."
    *   Visual feedback for validation errors (e.g., elements with errors highlighted with red borders, warning icons next to problematic items).
*   **UX Flow:** After the initial input analysis, the generated schema is displayed on the canvas -> the user explores the visual schema -> selects elements to view or modify their properties in the Properties Panel -> uses toolbar actions or context menus for structural changes -> the schema visualization updates in real-time to reflect changes.

### D. Validation and Error Display

*   **Purpose:** To communicate schema issues, inconsistencies, and suggestions for improvement clearly and actionably to the user.
*   **Integration:**
    *   **Inline Indicators:** Visual cues directly on the schema visualizer (e.g., a column with a data type error might be highlighted, or an icon might appear next to a table with a missing primary key).
    *   **Dedicated "Issues" Panel/Section:** A collapsib_le or separate panel that lists all current validation errors and warnings. Each item in the list should provide:
        *   A clear, concise description of the issue.
        *   (If possible) Suggestions for how to fix it.
        *   A clickable link or button that navigates to and highlights the relevant element in the schema visualizer.
*   **UX Flow:** Validation errors and warnings appear dynamically as the user modifies the schema or after a specific validation action is triggered -> user can click on an error message in the "Issues" panel -> the corresponding part of the schema on the canvas is highlighted or brought into focus -> user makes corrections based on the feedback -> error messages update or disappear.

### E. Export Options Screen

*   **Purpose:** Allows users to obtain the finalized schema in various formats suitable for different database systems or documentation purposes.
*   **Elements:**
    *   A dropdown menu to select the target database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite). The choice here may influence available export formats and the specific syntax of the generated DDL.
    *   A list of available export formats, which might include:
        *   SQL DDL Script (`.sql`)
        *   JSON (a generic, structured representation of the schema)
        *   XML (another generic schema representation)
        *   (Future) ORM Code stubs (e.g., Python SQLAlchemy models, Java JPA entities)
    *   An "Export" button associated with each available format or a general export button after selecting format and options.
    *   A preview area (optional but helpful) that shows a snippet of what the generated output will look like for the selected format and target system.
*   **UX Flow:** Once the user is satisfied with the schema design -> they navigate to the Export screen (possibly a tab or a modal dialog) -> select their target database system and desired export format -> click the "Export" button -> the schema file is generated and downloaded to their device.

## III. User Journey Summary

1.  **Onboarding/Project Setup:** User creates an account (if implemented) or directly proceeds to create a new project, giving it a name.
2.  **Input Phase:** User chooses an input method (text, file, or structured manual input), provides the necessary data, and initiates the analysis process.
3.  **Schema Generation & Visualization:** The system processes the input and displays an initial visual representation of the inferred or defined schema on the main workspace canvas.
4.  **Refinement Phase:**
    *   User explores the visual schema, dragging tables to rearrange for clarity.
    *   User selects tables, columns, or relationships to view and edit their properties in the Properties Panel (e.g., renaming, changing data types, adding constraints).
    *   User adds new tables or columns, or deletes existing ones, using toolbar buttons or context menus.
    *   User defines or modifies relationships between tables.
    *   User addresses any validation errors or warnings highlighted by the system.
5.  **Target System Selection:** User specifies the intended target database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), which may adjust available data types or validation rules.
6.  **Export Phase:** User selects the desired export format (e.g., SQL DDL) and downloads the generated schema file.
7.  **Iteration:** The user may go back to the input or refinement phases to make further changes, add more input sources, or adjust the schema based on new requirements, then re-export.

## IV. Tooltips, Examples, and Guidance

*   **Tooltips:** Will be used extensively on icons, buttons, form fields with non-obvious options, and complex settings to provide brief explanations on hover.
*   **Placeholders & Examples:** Text areas for natural language input will feature placeholder text with examples (e.g., "Describe your tables and fields like: 'A User table has an ID, an email, and a password. An Order table belongs to a User and has an order date and a total amount.'"). Examples of code snippets for supported languages will also be available.
*   **Contextual Help Sidebar:** A collapsible panel or section that provides tips, best practices, or more detailed explanations relevant to the current view, selected tool, or schema element.
*   **First-Use Tutorial/Walkthrough:** A brief, interactive guided tour for new users, highlighting key features, the overall workflow, and how to use the main tools. This could be a skippable overlay or a step-by-step guide.

This UI/UX design aims to create an intuitive, efficient, and supportive environment for users to translate various forms of input into well-structured database schemas.
