# Documentation and Support Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for providing comprehensive documentation and effective support for the application, aiming to enhance user experience and promote self-sufficiency.

## I. Documentation Goals

*   **Clarity & Accessibility:** Information will be presented in a clear, concise, and easily understandable manner. Documentation will be readily accessible and searchable.
*   **Comprehensiveness:** Documentation will cover all major features, functionalities, common use cases, and potential issues.
*   **Up-to-Date:** A key priority is to ensure that all documentation accurately reflects the current state of the application, including new features and changes.
*   **Empowerment:** The documentation aims to empower users to effectively use the application, troubleshoot common problems independently, and leverage its full potential.

## II. Documentation Components

### A. User Guide / Manual

*   **Format:** Primarily web-based (HTML, easily searchable) and integrated directly into the application or hosted on a dedicated support website. A downloadable PDF version may also be provided for offline access.
*   **Key Sections:**
    1.  **Introduction:**
        *   A high-level overview of the application's purpose and value proposition.
        *   A summary of key features and benefits for the user.
        *   System requirements (e.g., supported web browsers, internet connectivity).
    2.  **Getting Started:**
        *   Step-by-step instructions for creating an account (if user accounts are implemented).
        *   Guidance on navigating the main dashboard and understanding its elements.
        *   How to create a new project and an overview of the project workspace.
        *   A quick walkthrough of the main UI components and their functions.
    3.  **Input Methods (Detailed Chapters for Each):**
        *   **Processing Code Snippets:**
            *   List of supported programming languages, ORMs, and SQL dialects (including versions, if relevant).
            *   Instructions on how to input code (e.g., pasting directly). Future considerations: linking to code repositories.
            *   Clear examples of well-formed SQL DDL, Python ORM definitions (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django), and Java JPA entities that the parser handles effectively.
            *   Discussion of common pitfalls (e.g., obscure syntax, unsupported features) and how to avoid or work around them.
        *   **Processing Natural Language:**
            *   Best practices for writing clear and unambiguous textual descriptions for database entities and relationships.
            *   Illustrative examples of effective phrasing for defining tables, columns, data types, and relationships (e.g., "A 'User' table has an 'id', 'email', and 'password'. An 'Order' table belongs to a 'User' and contains an 'order_date' and 'total_amount'.").
            *   Explanation of how to understand and respond to ambiguity warnings or requests for clarification from the NLP engine.
        *   **Processing File Uploads:**
            *   List of supported file types (initially CSV, JSON).
            *   Detailed explanation of expected file structures (e.g., requirement for headers in CSV, structure of JSON objects/arrays).
            *   How the system infers data types from file content and how users can guide or override these inferences.
    4.  **Schema Visualization & Editing:**
        *   A comprehensive guide to using the visual schema editor interface.
        *   Instructions on how to add, modify (rename, change types), and delete tables and columns.
        *   Detailed steps for defining, editing, and deleting relationships between tables, including specifying cardinality and referential integrity.
        *   How to effectively use the properties panel to inspect and modify selected schema elements.
        *   Explanation of primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, not-null constraints, and other common database constraints.
    5.  **Validation and Error Handling:**
        *   Guidance on interpreting validation messages, distinguishing between critical errors and informational warnings.
        *   A list of common error types, their potential causes, and recommended steps for resolution.
    6.  **Exporting Schemas:**
        *   Instructions on how to select the target database system for export.
        *   Detailed explanation of each available export format (SQL, JSON, XML), including their purpose and structure.
        *   Guidance on using export options (e.g., include comments, drop existing objects).
    7.  **Advanced Topics (To be added as features are developed):**
        *   Using the structured input method for manual schema definition.
        *   Managing different versions of a project (if versioning is implemented).
        *   Collaboration features (if implemented).
    8.  **Troubleshooting:**
        *   A section addressing common issues users might encounter (e.g., login problems, slow performance, unexpected parsing results) and their solutions.
        *   Guidance on how to interpret error logs or messages if they are exposed to users in any way.
    9.  **FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):**
        *   A curated list of quick answers to the most common questions users have.

### B. In-App Guidance

*   **Tooltips:** Concise explanations appearing on hover for buttons, icons, form fields with non-obvious options, and complex settings.
*   **Placeholder Text & Examples:** Pre-filled examples in input fields (e.g., showing example natural language phrases for schema description, or a basic SQL CREATE TABLE structure).
*   **Contextual Help Popups/Modals:** For more complex features or sections, users can click a help icon (e.g., "?") to open a small popup or modal window with relevant information or a link to the detailed documentation.
*   **Guided Tours / Walkthroughs:** Interactive tutorials for first-time users or when introducing new major features. Libraries like Shepherd.js or Intro.js could be used to highlight UI elements and guide users through key workflows.

### C. API Documentation (If a public Backend API is exposed)

*   **Format:** Generated and maintained using industry-standard tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
*   **Content:** Comprehensive details for each API endpoint, including:
    *   HTTP methods, URL paths.
    *   Request parameters (path, query, body).
    *   Expected request and response formats (JSON schemas).
    *   Authentication methods and security requirements.
    *   Error codes and messages.

## III. Support Strategy

### A. Self-Service Support

*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** The primary resource for users to find answers and solve problems independently.
*   **Searchable FAQ:** A readily accessible and searchable FAQ section within the application or on the support website.
*   **Community Forum (Future Consideration):**
    *   A dedicated online space for users to ask questions, share their solutions, discuss best practices, and provide mutual support.
    *   This would be moderated by the development team or designated community managers.

### B. Direct Support Channels (Phased Approach)

*   **Phase 1 (Initial Launch & Early Adopters):**
    *   **Email Support:** A dedicated support email address (e.g., `support@applicationdomain.com`). Clear targets for response times will be set (e.g., within 24-48 business hours).
*   **Phase 2 (Growth & Wider User Base):**
    *   **In-App Support Widget/Contact Form:** Allow users to submit support queries directly from within the application. This can help capture valuable context (e.g., current project ID, user account information, browser version) automatically.
    *   Consider implementing a ticketing system (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk, HubSpot Service Hub) to efficiently manage, track, and respond to support requests.
*   **Phase 3 (Scale & Premium Offerings - Optional):**
    *   **Live Chat Support:** Offer real-time chat support, possibly for premium-tier users or during specific business hours.

### C. Feedback Mechanism

*   Provide an easy and visible way for users to report bugs, suggest new features, or provide general feedback about their experience (e.g., a "Feedback" button or link in the application footer or help menu).

## IV. Documentation Maintenance

*   **Integral to Development:** Documentation updates will be considered an integral part of the development lifecycle. New features or significant changes to existing ones will not be considered "done" until corresponding documentation is also updated.
*   **Assigned Responsibility:** Clear responsibility will be assigned for creating and updating documentation (e.g., developers for technical accuracy, technical writers for clarity and structure, or QA for verification).
*   **Regular Reviews:** Documentation will be periodically reviewed (e.g., quarterly or bi-annually) and revised to ensure its clarity, accuracy, and completeness, and to remove outdated information.
*   **User Feedback Driven:** Feedback received through support channels or the feedback mechanism will be used to identify areas where documentation can be improved or expanded.

This documentation and support strategy is designed to be iterative and will evolve based on user needs and the application's growth. The primary goal is to provide users with the resources they need to succeed with the application and to offer timely and effective help when they encounter problems.
