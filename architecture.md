# Automatic Database Schema Generation: System Architecture

## 1. Introduction

### Overview
This document outlines the core architecture for the Automatic Database Schema Generation application. The application aims to simplify and accelerate the database design process by automatically generating database schemas from various input sources, such as existing code, natural language descriptions, or data files.

### Goals of the Architecture
The architecture is designed with the following goals in mind:
*   **Modularity:** Components are designed to be independent and interchangeable where possible, facilitating easier development, testing, and maintenance.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle increasing numbers of users and larger processing tasks.
*   **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces will make the system easier to understand and modify over time.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for the addition of new input parsers, output database targets, and features with minimal disruption.
*   **Reliability:** The system should be robust and provide consistent results.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1. Frontend
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting data (e.g., uploading files, pasting code, writing text).
    *   Allow users to configure generation options and select target database systems.
    *   Visualize the generated database schema (e.g., ER diagrams).
    *   Enable users to manually edit and refine the generated schema.
*   **Technology:**
    *   **Primary:** React (with TypeScript) for a component-based, type-safe UI.
    *   **Alternatives:** Vue.js, Angular.
*   **Key Libraries/Considerations:**
    *   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or Zustand for managing complex application state.
    *   **UI Component Library:** Material-UI or Ant Design for pre-built, customizable UI components.
    *   **Schema Visualization:** React Flow, or a custom SVG-based solution for interactive diagrams.
    *   **Form Handling:** Formik or React Hook Form.

### 2.2. Backend API
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Receive and process requests from the Frontend.
    *   Orchestrate the schema generation process by invoking the Parsing & Analysis Engine.
    *   Manage user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
    *   Handle project creation, storage, and versioning of schemas and input data.
*   **Technology:**
    *   **Primary:** Python with FastAPI for its high performance, asynchronous capabilities, automatic data validation (via Pydantic), and OpenAPI/Swagger UI generation.
    *   **Alternatives:** Django (more batteries-included, suitable if extensive admin features are needed quickly), Node.js with Express (JavaScript ecosystem, good for I/O bound tasks).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **API Design:** RESTful principles for clear and stateless communication.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing endpoints. OAuth2 for third-party authentication if needed.
    *   **Background Task Management:** Integration with a task queue (e.g., Celery) for offloading long-running parsing and analysis tasks.
    *   **Data Validation:** Pydantic models for request and response validation.

### 2.3. Parsing & Analysis Engine
*   **Purpose:** This is the core logic unit of the application. It takes various forms of input, parses them to understand their structure and semantics, and then infers or translates this understanding into a generic database schema representation. This intermediate representation is then converted to a specific database schema.
*   **Technology:** Python, due to its strong text processing libraries, extensive NLP tools, and suitability for algorithmic tasks. This engine will likely be a module or set of modules directly used by the Backend API, or potentially a separate microservice.
*   **Sub-modules:**
    *   **Input Processors/Parsers:**
        *   **Code Parsers:**
            *   SQL (DDL, DML): Libraries like `sqlparse` or potentially ANTLR-generated parsers for complex dialects.
            *   Python ORM (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM): Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing (`ast` module) or dedicated introspection tools.
            *   Java JPA/Hibernate: XML parsing for mapping files, potentially Java parsing libraries if source code analysis is needed.
        *   **Natural Language Processor (NLP):**
            *   Libraries: spaCy or NLTK.
            *   Tasks: Entity recognition (identifying potential tables, columns), relationship extraction (detecting links between entities), intent analysis.
        *   **File Parsers:**
            *   CSV: Python's built-in `csv` module.
            *   JSON: Python's built-in `json` module.
            *   Other structured formats (XML, YAML): `xml.etree.ElementTree`, `PyYAML`.
    *   **Schema Inference Logic:**
        *   Custom algorithms and heuristics to map parsed elements (tokens, entities, relationships) to database constructs (tables, columns, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, indexes).
        *   Conflict resolution and ambiguity handling.
    *   **Intermediate Schema Representation:** A defined internal model (e.g., Python classes or a structured dictionary) that represents a database schema agnostically.
    *   **Database-Specific Adapters/Generators:**
        *   Modules responsible for translating the intermediate schema representation into DDL statements for target database systems.
        *   Examples: MySQL adapter, PostgreSQL adapter, MongoDB (schema suggestions for a NoSQL DB).

### 2.4. Application Database
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Store user account information (credentials, profiles).
    *   Manage user projects, including their input data (or references to it), configuration settings, and the generated schemas (multiple versions if supported).
    *   Potentially cache intermediate results from the Parsing & Analysis Engine for performance.
*   **Technology:**
    *   **Primary:** PostgreSQL for its robustness, ACID compliance, strong relational integrity, and advanced features like JSONB support (useful for storing flexible project data or schema representations).
    *   **Alternatives:** MongoDB (if a more document-oriented approach is preferred for project data and schema flexibility is paramount, though relational aspects of user data might be harder to manage). MySQL is also a viable relational alternative.

## 3. Communication Flow

*   **Frontend <-> Backend API:**
    *   Primarily via HTTPS using RESTful API calls. Payloads will be in JSON format.
    *   WebSocket communication might be considered for future enhancements requiring real-time updates (e.g., live validation feedback during schema editing, collaborative features), but the initial design will focus on standard HTTP request/response.

*   **Backend API -> Parsing & Analysis Engine:**
    *   **If integrated as a Python module:** Direct Python function/method calls within the FastAPI application process. This is simpler for initial development.
    *   **If deployed as a separate microservice (for scalability/decoupling):** Inter-service communication via:
        *   **gRPC:** For performance-sensitive, internal communication.
        *   **REST API:** Simpler to implement but potentially higher overhead.
    *   For long-running or resource-intensive parsing/analysis tasks, the Backend API will delegate these to a background task queue.

*   **Background Task Queue (e.g., Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ as a message broker):**
    *   The Backend API places tasks (e.g., "generate schema from this large SQL DDL file," "analyze this natural language description") onto the queue.
    *   Dedicated worker processes (which can be part of the Parsing & Analysis Engine or scaled independently) pick up tasks from the queue.
    *   Workers execute the parsing and analysis logic.
    *   Results are stored (e.g., in the Application Database or a temporary store), and the Backend API can be notified of task completion (e.g., via webhook, or the frontend can poll for status).

*   **Backend API <-> Application Database:**
    *   Standard database connections using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like SQLAlchemy (for Python applications) or a query builder. This abstracts direct SQL interaction and helps prevent SQL injection.

## 4. Deployment Considerations (High-Level)

*   **Containerization:**
    *   All services (Frontend, Backend API, Parsing & Analysis Engine workers, if separate) will be containerized using Docker. This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
*   **Orchestration:**
    *   For scalability, resilience, and automated deployment, Kubernetes (K8s) is the recommended orchestration platform. This might be overkill for initial small-scale deployments but is a good long-term goal. Alternatives include Docker Swarm or managed services like AWS ECS/Fargate, Google Cloud Run.
*   **Database Deployment:**
    *   The Application Database (e.g., PostgreSQL) should be run as a separate, persistent instance. Managed database services (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) are recommended for production to handle backups, scaling, and maintenance.
*   **CI/CD:**
    *   Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for automated testing, building, and deployment of application updates.
