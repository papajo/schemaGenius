## ü§Ø When Markdown Gets a Little Gugly, But in a Good Way! ü§Ø

`gugly-mdness` is a quirky and opinionated tool designed to add a unique flavor to your Markdown files. Whether you're looking to generate slightly unconventional Markdown, apply specific formatting rules that aren't quite standard, or just have some fun with your documentation, `gugly-mdness` is here to help you embrace the delightful chaos.

## ‚ú® Features

While the exact "gugly" aspects are meant to be discovered, here are some hypothetical features `gugly-mdness` *might* offer:

* **Opinionated Markdown Generation:** Generate Markdown with specific, perhaps slightly unusual, formatting choices.
* **Automated "Guglification":** Transform existing Markdown to apply a set of pre-defined "gugly" rules (e.g., specific heading styles, quirky link formatting, or unique list item markers).
* **Customizable "Gugly" Rules:** Define your own set of rules to make Markdown truly unique.
* **CLI Integration:** Easily process Markdown files from your command line.
* **Lightweight and Fast:** Designed to be efficient for quick transformations.

Once installed, you can use `gugly-mdness` via its command-line interface.

```bash
node index.js input.md --dry-run
```

### Advanced Usage (Hypothetical)

`gugly-mdness` might also allow you to specify particular "gugly" presets or configurations:

```bash
node index.js input.md -o output.md --preset crazy-links
```

*(Refer to the `docs` directory or run `node index.js --help` for all available options and presets.)*
