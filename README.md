# SchemaGenius - Automatic Database Schema Generation (Design Phase)

## Description

SchemaGenius is a planned application designed to automatically generate database schemas based on various user inputs. This includes code snippets (SQL, Python ORMs, Java JPA), natural language descriptions, and structured data files (CSV, JSON). The goal is to provide an intelligent, user-friendly tool that streamlines the initial phases of database design.

## Current Status

This repository currently contains the **initial design documents** for the SchemaGenius application. The work done so far focuses on outlining the architecture, features, user experience, and technical considerations for building the application. No implementation has begun yet.

## Design Documents

The core design of SchemaGenius is detailed in the following documents:

*   **`final_design_document.md`**: A comprehensive document consolidating all aspects of the application's design.
    *   `architecture.md`: Outlines the core components (Frontend, Backend API, Parsing & Analysis Engine, Application Database), their technologies, and communication flows.
    *   `parsing_engine_details.md`: Details the specifics of the Parsing and Analysis Engine, including various input parsers, NLP approach, schema inference logic, and database-specific adapters.
    *   `ui_ux_design.md`: Describes the user interface with textual wireframes for key screens, details the user journey, and specifies UI elements for schema visualization and manipulation.
    *   `validation_error_handling.md`: Defines the strategy for schema validation at different stages, how errors are communicated, and the types of suggestions offered.
    *   `export_formats_options.md`: Specifies the structure of export formats (SQL DDL, JSON, XML) and user-configurable options during export.
    *   `scalability_performance.md`: Identifies potential bottlenecks and proposes solutions for scalability and performance across the application.
    *   `application_documentation_structure.md`: Outlines the structure for user guides, FAQs, and other support materials for the application.

## Future Work

The next phase for this project will be the implementation of the SchemaGenius application based on the designs outlined in these documents. This will involve:

1.  Setting up the development environment.
2.  Developing the backend API and parsing engine.
3.  Building the frontend user interface.
4.  Implementing the schema generation, validation, and export functionalities.
5.  Thorough testing and iteration.
